# DMA Audio Implementation Plan

## Current Status: analogRead() only (no real DMA)

### What needs to be implemented for real DMA:

1. **ADC Setup with DMA**
   - Configure ADC for continuous conversion
   - Set up DMA channel to transfer ADC results
   - Double buffering for continuous operation

2. **DMA Channel Setup**
   - Allocate DMA channel
   - Configure transfer from ADC FIFO to memory buffers
   - Set up interrupts for buffer completion

3. **Buffer Management**
   - Implement ping-pong buffering
   - Handle buffer swapping in DMA interrupt
   - Ensure thread-safe access between cores

4. **Interrupt Handler**
   - Real DMA interrupt processing
   - Buffer status management
   - Error handling (overruns, etc.)

### Code changes needed:

```cpp
// In initializeDma():
- Set up ADC for free running mode
- Configure DMA channel
- Enable DMA interrupts
- Start continuous conversion

// In handleDmaInterrupt():
- Swap active buffer
- Copy data to ring buffer
- Set buffer ready flags
- Handle overruns
```

### Advantages of real DMA:
- Lower CPU usage on Core1
- More precise timing
- Higher throughput possible
- Better real-time performance

### Current analogRead() advantages:
- Simple and working
- Easy to debug
- Already tested
- No interrupt complexity
